17687,[5.x]: Manual sorting of routes is not accessible,"### What happened?

### Description

I was looking for a way to define the order of precedences for routes defined in Settings → Routes in the Control Panel. I discovered by accident that you can drag-and-drop the routes to rearrange them, and that the order in which they are placed determines the precedence if more than one route can apply to a given URL.

I can't find any documentation for this feature, and the interface doesn't provide any affordance for this UI interaction.

### Expected behavior

- Add drag handles to the routes to indicate that they can be rearranged through drag-and-drop, similar to elements in a structure.
- The fact that the order of the routes determines the order of precedence should be noted on that page itself, and/or in the [documentation on dynamic routes](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/system/routing.html#dynamic-routes).
- I don't think there's a keyboard alternative for the drag-and-drop interaction, that should probably be added as well?

7541,Register new user- accessibility,"### Below is an overview of accessibility issues on the Register New User page

#### Account

- The Account and Permissions tabs need appropriate role, state  and properties- see [aria example with automatic activation](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/examples/tabs/tabs-1/tabs.html) and [aria example with manual activation](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/examples/tabs/tabs-2/tabs.html) (Fixed with #10606)
![tabs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47136246/107581543-21e65b80-6bf0-11eb-8753-ad36b4a0e301.png) 
- Status update for not being able to save a user not picked up by screen reader software, although it wouldn’t need to be picked up if the following point was implemented
![status](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47136246/107581471-04b18d00-6bf0-11eb-8a28-b3832cd89863.png)
- It would be good if the error messages were associated with input fields using `aria-describedby` and the keyboard focus was moved to  the first incorrect field 
- It would be good to either move the save button below the form or to make sure it is part of  the `<form>` element  so that the user can just hit enter to save changes

#### Permissions

- Checkboxes should be grouped to provide context
- The select All elements are not keyboard accessible
- There is 1.47:1 contrast ratio between the dark body text and the Select All elements. Technically, bumping contrast ratio to at least 3:1 would work for WCAG compliance but I’d recommend using another visual clue, e.g. underline, or border with 3:1 contrast ratio against the background
- Information buttons need aria-expanded and aria-controls; I also think it would be better if they didn’t receive keyboard focus when the checkbox is disabled and their name was more descriptive (e.g. More about moderate users)

7486,Accessibility of Users landing page,"### Overview of accessibility issues found on the Users landing page

- Status updates are not picked up by screen readers-  “User unsuspended”,  ""User suspended"", “User deleted”

- The same dialog does not trap keyboard focus
- The remove button that deletes selected user is not keyboard accessible
- Label for transferring content to another user might be a bit confusing, it says “transfer to”; my suggestion is to give the radio button the “transfer to another user” label and append the choose user button below the radio buttons
- It would also be good to wrap those radio buttons with `role=”radiogroup”` and associate the legend using `aria-labelledby`
- It’s not possible to select a user that I would like to transfer the content to when using the keyboard only
- Checkboxes in the thumbnail view should have `role=”checkbox”` and `aria-checked`; it’s also a bit confusing that they can be navigated using arrow keys only; I think that it would be better if each of them  was a Tab stop

- Error message for missing the required field in the edit pop-up not communicated to screen reader users; my suggestion is to move keyboard focus to the incorrect field and associate the error message with the input using `aria-describedby`
- Username field in the edit user popup would benefit from the `required `attribute

7416,Keyboard Focus- Accessibility,"### Below are keyboard focus issues/improvements recommendations for the Assets and the Categories section

- When the page is open, the focus is landing on the search button then goes through sort by, view and then to asset/ categories folders (likely to miss the select button for trashed an all); a more logical flow would be to land on the folders and then the filters
![focus-order](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47136246/104253544-a8324500-546c-11eb-894c-3b62f6d144ee.png)
- Poor keyboard focus indication
-   Whenever the trigger buttonin the navigation panel  is activated using the keyboard, the focus moves away from the component, need to do shift + tab to come back  (**Assets page only**)
- Illogical focus order for the export button, after it’s activated the next Tab stop is the “By Craft Pro” instead of the “Export type” button 
![illogical-focus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47136246/104254051-e5e39d80-546d-11eb-8f8c-a5279f1a7f8b.png)
- Copy url and copy reference tag dialogs don’t move keyboard focus into the read-only input and do not trap it  (Assets page only)
![copy-url-focus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47136246/104254285-6904f380-546e-11eb-80b6-8435cae64ddf.png)
- Focus is not moved inside the customise dialog when activated; it’s also not trapped and doesn’t come back to the trigger; related #7297
![asset-fields](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47136246/104254572-06f8be00-546f-11eb-86ef-89661df2bf61.png)
![customise](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47136246/104254310-77530f80-546e-11eb-9934-87a0916b6c2d.png)
- From a screen reader perspective, it’s possible not to realise that an action button has appeared after selecting an asset;  it feels more natural for the button to appear after the table; also, I think that it would be better if the table cells were navigable using the arrow keys and the Tab key would move out of the table-  it would improve navigation for keyboard users (just like the grid examples in aria (it should also be a grid because it has some interactive components)
![action-button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47136246/104254088-f8f66d80-546d-11eb-8350-ff3bb7276ed1.png)

- Calendar picker doesn't seem to be keyboard-accessible. 
I think it's using jQuery UI, [this post from Deque may be helpful](https://www.deque.com/blog/accessible-jquery-ui-datepicker/). Or [Deque's demo here](https://dequeuniversity.com/library/aria/date-picker).
Actually those examples look kind of hacky and janky... maybe we can use [the WAI-ARIA example](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/examples/dialog-modal/datepicker-dialog.html) or [IBM's Vue a11y datepicker](https://ibm.github.io/vue-a11y-calendar/components/datepicker).
- It's not clear what format or constraints apply to the date or time, especially when a user is typing directly into the input rather than using the datepicker or time dropdown. Date formatting should be validated, sometimes the date is able to be saved even though the format is wrong (https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/7308#issuecomment-754990576). Note: the format depends on the user's (formatting) locale settings.
- <s>Inputs are not associated with labels. For the date-only and time-only fields, the visible label can be its label. This will also put the input into focus when the label is clicked. For the date/time fields, the date field and time field should have `aria-label` to indicate one is for date and one is for time.</s> (fixed)
- <s>The calendar and clock icons for date/time fields in the details sidebar have insufficient contrast.</s> (fixed)
- <s>Not sure if it's clear that the x/remove icon to the right of the time field clears both the date and time.</s> (fixed)
- <s>The x/remove icon should be in a button element rather than an anchor.</s> (fixed)
- <s>The x/remove icon has insufficient contrast.</s> (fixed)

7308,Details sidebar accessibility,"### Description
The details sidebar can be found on the right side of several edit views: assets, entries, categories, users. There may be more instances to identify.
![Screenshot of details sidebar.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17884198/102730417-93d5af00-42e9-11eb-943c-25bd25292def.png)

#### Accessibility notes for this area:

##### All
- The editable fields don't have a border around them, so it's not clear that they are editable form fields. This is especially the case when there's only one editable field and no close/x icons nearby, such as a ""filename"" for assets:
![Screenshot of Filename field.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17884198/102730702-6dfcda00-42ea-11eb-904b-adfaecc0a255.png)
- It would be helpful to label the top and bottom boxes. Not sure of good headings yet, but something that indicates the top section is editable and the bottom section is informative.
- h5 elements are causing heading level errors. I think these don't necessarily need to be headings. Maybe change to definition lists.

##### Assets
- The uploaded by author link text has insufficient contrast.

##### Entries
- The author selection doesn't seem to be keyboard operable.
- The remove button on the author field is announced before the author's name, which might be confusing.
- The ""Notes about your changes"" text box has insufficient contrast and is using a placeholder as a label.
- Date and author remove button hover styles are inconsistent (red on author, gray on date)

**Moved date/time field related issues to #7321**

##### Users
- The gear icon menu has insufficient contrast
- The delete functionality is inconsistent with the other editable views. It is located under a gear icon menu rather than within the save menu.

These issues compromise perceivability, operability, and the ability to reliably identify and interact with content for users with disabilities.",,"The Craft CMS details sidebar suffers from several accessibility barriers—mis‑ordered headings, missing visual cues for editable fields, poor focus and contrast styling, and confusing author‑selection controls. The issue has been reported and a few mitigation ideas have been suggested, but no follow‑up or fix has been documented.","The sidebar violates multiple WCAG 2.2 Success Criteria: * **1.3.1 (Info & Relationships)** – `h5` elements are used without a clear hierarchical context, causing screen‑reader users to encounter non‑sequential heading order. * **1.3.2 (Meaningful Sequence)** – The “remove” button precedes the author name, confusing the reading sequence. * **1.4.1 (Use of Color)** – Links and icons (e.g., uploaded‑by author, gear menu) lack sufficient contrast with the background. * **1.4.3 (Contrast (Minimum))** – Text fields such as the “Notes about your changes” placeholder and the “Filename” field do not meet the required contrast ratio, obscuring content for low‑vision users. * **1.4.11 (Content on Hover or Focus)** – The switch and choose button provide no focus outline, violating the requirement for visible focus indicators. * **1.4.12 (Non‑Text Contrast)** – The gear‑icon menu’s delete option has low contrast against its background. These barriers hinder users with visual impairments, keyboard‑only navigation, and screen‑reader usage from effectively interacting with the sidebar.",Initial report only.,"# 1 ajanec01: Reported heading level errors and suggested replacing `<h5>` with a `<dl>`; also noted other accessibility concerns such as poor focus indication and author‑selection issues. # 2 ajanec01: Added further observations—poor focus on the choose button and switch, a side note about the author.
