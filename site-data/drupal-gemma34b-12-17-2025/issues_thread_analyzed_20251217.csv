3426798,CKEditor 5 text area doesn't have appropriate aria-label for screen reader,CKEditor 5 text area doesn't have appropriate aria-label for screen reader,https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3426798,drupal,Needs work,Normal,ckeditor5.module,11.x-dev,1 year 9 months,General,General,"Users relying on screen readers may experience difficulty identifying and interacting with the CKEditor 5 text area due to the absence of a clear, descriptive `aria-label` attribute. This limits the screen reader’s ability to convey the purpose and function of the text area to the user, creating a barrier to access.","The issue reports a missing `aria-label` for the CKEditor 5 text area. This is a common accessibility concern. The first step is to investigate if a native HTML label can be applied to the text area. If a native `<label>` element is present and correctly associated with the text area via the `for` attribute referencing the text area's `id`, the issue is resolved. If a native label isn't feasible, then implement an `aria-label` attribute. The `aria-label` should accurately describe the purpose of the text area (e.g., ""Insert text here""). Ensure the `aria-label` is concise and does not contain redundant information.  Avoid overly descriptive labels; focus on the user’s intent.  Consider using a descriptive text within the CKEditor 5 configuration that could then be used in the `aria-label` if necessary.  Do *not* use `aria-labelledby` without a clear, visible element to associate with; this can create confusion.  Prioritize semantic HTML; ARIA should be used sparingly and only to supplement, not replace, native accessibility features.","CKEditor 5’s text area lacks a clear, accessible help message (aria-label) when required, impacting screen reader users. The issue is actively being addressed with a proposed merge request that aims to correctly configure the editor's labels.","Initial report identified that CKEditor 5's text area doesn't provide a readily accessible help message (via aria-label) when the field is marked as required. Multiple contributors have engaged in discussing this, including timohuisman who has created a merge request (MR7170) to address the labeling issue.

The specific impact depends on the visual design and the user's individual needs.","The reported issue describes a visual artifact – the consistent display of lines within table structures. This likely stems from CSS styling that is not correctly managing table borders or spacing.  The initial focus should be on refactoring the CSS to remove these persistent lines.  Specifically, investigate if the table’s `border-collapse` property is set to ‘collapse’ or if any borders are being explicitly defined on the `<td>` or `<th>` elements.  Ensure that `border-spacing` is appropriately configured.  Consider using CSS grid or flexbox for layout if the table structure is complex and requires more control over spacing.  If this persists, verify that the table's `border` style is not being inadvertently applied to elements that shouldn't have borders.  Avoid using ARIA attributes to address this visual issue; it is a styling problem.","The Table Drag feature consistently displays lines, impacting the visual clarity of the interface.
