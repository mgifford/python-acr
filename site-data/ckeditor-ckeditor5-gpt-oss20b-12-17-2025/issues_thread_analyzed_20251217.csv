19347,WCAG 2.5.2 (Level A) : Actions must not trigger on press or touch down,"## 📝 Provide detailed reproduction steps (if any)

1. …Activate any CKEditor element that has a ""balloon"" interface.
2. …Click anywhere outside of the balloon interface to dismiss it
3. …The balloon interface is dismissed on key/press down, rather than mouse up or finger-lift.

### ✔️ Expected result

The balloon interface is dismissed on mouse up or finger-lift.

### ❌ Actual result

The balloon interface is dismissed on key/press down, rather than mouse up or finger-lift.

### Background
This constitutes a failure a Level A Success Criterion as documented in https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pointer-cancellation.html

The specific failure is documented in https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F101 :

> The objective of this Failure is to describe situations where:
> 
>     Controls are set to activate functionality on the down-event of a pointer;
>     No further mechanism to abort or undo is available;
>     The up-event does not reverse the outcome of the activation;
>     It is not essential for the functionality to execute and complete on the down-event.

### Proposed resolution
Change the behavior so that balloons are dismissed on the ""up"" event, rather than the ""down"" event.

19163,Link (edit mode) - Bookmarks - not accessible with screen reader,"## 📝 Provide detailed reproduction steps (if any)

1. Open https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/link.html
2. Insert Link (use button or shorcut)
3. Select ""Bookmarks"" in the balloon panel

### ✔️ Expected result

The screen reader should announce:

- List
- with 2 entries
- Heritage button

### ❌ Actual result

The Screen reader announces:

- List
- Heritage button

### ❓ Possible solution

- Number of elements = 0: Display only an informational text (already implemented).
- Number of elements = 1: Both `<ul>` and `<li>` have the attribute `role=""presentation""` → In screen readers, the button is announced without a list structure.
- Number of elements > 1: `<ul>` and all `<li>` elements have no `role=""presentation""` attribute → In screen readers, the list is announced correctly as a list.

19161,Link (edit mode) - new options - not accessible with screen reader,"## 📝 Provide detailed reproduction steps (if any)

1. Open https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/link.html
2. Insert Link (use button or shorcut)
3. Navigate to ""Bookmarks"" with ""Tab"" key

### ✔️ Expected result

- The options at the end of the balloon panel should consist only of interactive buttons (no other element types).
- Navigation between these option buttons should be possible only via the Tab key (no arrow-key navigation or other unexpected focus changes).
- When focused (first option), the screen reader should announce: ""Bookmarks button""

### ❌ Actual result

- The options at the end of the balloon panel are implemented as unordered list (`<ul>`).
- Navigation between these options is currently possible using the Tab key as well as the Arrow Up and Arrow Down keys.
- When focus is on the first option, the screen reader announces: ""List"" ""Bookmarks button""

### ❓ Possible solution

- Hide the list structure from assistive technologies by adding `role=""presentation""` to `<ul>` element.
- Remove arrow key (Arrow Up / Arrow Down) navigation between the option buttons so that navigation is only possible via the Tab key.

## 📃 Other details

Alternative implementation suggestion — if the component is intended to behave like a navigation menu:

- Number of elements = 0: Do not display the area (already implemented).
- Number of elements = 1: Both `<ul>` and `<li>` have the attribute `role=""presentation""` → The button is announced by the screen reader without any list structure.
- Number of elements > 1: `<ul>` and all `<li>` elements have no `role=""presentation""` attribute → The list is announced by the screen reader as an actual list.
- Navigation to the list should be done via the Tab key.
- Navigation within the list should be possible only via the Arrow Up / Arrow Down keys (not via Tab).
- Pressing Arrow Right should follow the chevron and trigger the selected option.

1. Load the official demo at https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/demo/feature-rich/
2. Inspect the page and look for the `.ck-body-wrapper` beneath the `<body>` element.
3. Inside of the `.ck ck-aria-live-announcer` container are two `aria-live` sections, each containing an `ul` without any items.

### ✔️ Expected result

The list elements should either be dynamically inserted when there is something to announce or be marked as `aria-hidden` while they do not contain any content.

### ❌ Actual result

The lists exists even if there are zero list items.

18465,Bookmark is not fully accessible,"## 📝 Provide detailed reproduction steps (if any)

1. Use the bookmark tool on static text such as a heading
2. Create a link to that bookmark tool

### ✔️ Expected result

The static text that is the destination of the link is missing the `tabindex=""-1""` attribute. This is necessary to ensure that all assistive technologies tracking focus can be ""moved"" to that content. 

### ❌ Actual result

It appears as though the `tabindex=""-1""` attribute is absent and the link only relies on fragment navigation (via `href` and `id` matching)

Some assistive tech affected are:
* Windows Screen Magnifier with Keyboard Focus tracking turned on: Viewport resets to the top-left corner.
* iOS 18.3.2/ 17.4 VoiceOver & Safari: Focus is reset to the top of the page.
* iOS 17.4 Full Keyboard Access turned on, external keyboard & Safari: Focus is reset to the top of the page.
* JAWS 2023 & Chrome 124: The page structure is unexpectedly announced starting with the page title. Virtual cursor is then set on the correct content navigated.

### ❓ Possible solution

When we're linking to static content that doesn't already have the `tabindex` attribute, we should add it for the user.

Use `tabindex=""-1""` and not `tabindex=""0""` nor `tabindex=""1""` (or any positive number) to avoid messing up sequential focus navigation orders.

17200,Toolbar/Menubar focus keyboard shortcuts are shifting focus when a fullscreen modal/dialog is opened,"## 📝 Provide detailed reproduction steps (if any)

1. Open Feature-rich demo (https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/demo/feature-rich/)

This focus shift occurs while the modal remains open, preventing the user from returning focus to the modal or closing it via keyboard.
