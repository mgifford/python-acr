Without specific details, it is impossible to determine the exact nature and severity of the accessibility barrier, but it suggests potential issues with visibility, contrast, or usability for users relying on high contrast settings.","To address this issue, first identify the specific elements or interactions that are not functioning correctly in high contrast mode. Common problems include insufficient contrast between text and background, missing or incorrect border styles, and images that obscure text. Use browser developer tools to inspect the rendered styles when high contrast mode is enabled. Ensure that all text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background (3:1 for large text). Use the `forced-colors` CSS media query to detect when high contrast mode is active and apply appropriate styles. Prefer system colors (e.g., `Canvas`, `CanvasText`, `LinkText`) for text, backgrounds, and borders to ensure compatibility with user-defined color schemes.
