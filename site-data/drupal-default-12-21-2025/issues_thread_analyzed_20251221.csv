If JavaScript is *required* to achieve the desired interaction, then use ARIA attributes judiciously to provide alternative ways for users to trigger the same behaviour. Specifically, investigate if the pointer cancellation is truly necessary – often, a well-designed interaction can be achieved with standard keyboard navigation. Consider using `role=""dialog""` and `role=""alert""` with appropriate ARIA attributes to provide focus management for modal dialogs created by JavaScript.  Avoid directly interfering with the natural pointer cancellation behavior of the browser.

Initially, evaluate if a modal dialog with maximized dimensions can adequately address the need. If this is insufficient, focus on ensuring the editor's content remains accessible within the modal.

Specifically, use `role=""dialog""` on the modal and `aria-modal=""true""` to communicate its modal nature. Ensure focus management within the modal using appropriate `tabindex` values and keyboard navigation. Consider using keyboard shortcuts for full-screen activation and exit.  Avoid adding unnecessary visual styling that might cause focus issues or negatively impact screen reader users.

This is typically achieved using the `tabindex` attribute, but it’s crucial to use this sparingly and only as a last resort.  The first step is to ensure the mobile navigation is logically structured with clear headings and sufficient keyboard focus order.  Specifically, ensure that the navigation items are focusable via the `Tab` key.  If focus *does* escape the navigation on mobile, consider using `tabindex=""0""` on the navigation element and then carefully control the tab order using the `tabindex` attribute.  Apply `tabindex=""0""` only to the navigation container and ensure it is the *first* element in the tab order. Test thoroughly with keyboard-only navigation to confirm the expected behavior.
