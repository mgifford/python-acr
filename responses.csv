The “reduce motion” setting in the operating system should be respected,https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3542774,Needs review,Major,navigation.module,,The “reduce motion” setting in the operating system should be respected,"1.4.10 Focus on Perceptual Shortcomings - The issue directly relates to a perceptual shortcoming – the inability to avoid animations that could cause discomfort or distraction. This violates 1.4.10, which requires that websites do not present content in a way that exploits a user's known perceptual limitations.","This Drupal site exhibits a significant accessibility barrier by failing to respect user-configured ""reduce motion"" settings within their operating systems. This impacts users with vestibular disorders, migraines, or other sensitivities to animation and movement, causing potential discomfort, nausea, or distraction.  The absence of respect for these settings violates best practices for inclusive design and can contribute to a negative user experience. Remediation is required to ensure consistent accessibility across different operating systems and user preferences.","The core issue here is the Drupal theme's handling of animation and transitions. Currently, the theme isn’t checking the user’s operating system’s “reduce motion” setting (often accessible via system settings in Windows and macOS).  To fix this, the theme needs to be modified to detect this setting.  This detection is likely to involve checking the `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS media query.  If this setting is active, the theme should disable or significantly reduce all animations and transitions. There may not be a readily available, dedicated patch. The best approach will likely involve modifying the theme’s CSS to include this media query and appropriately adjust animation properties.  Testing across Windows, macOS, and potentially iOS/Android is crucial. Potential areas to investigate include transitions, animations within blocks, and any interactive elements."
"Cached forms can have duplicate HTML IDs, which disrupts accessible form labels",https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/1852090,Needs work,Major,forms system,,"Cached forms can have duplicate HTML IDs, which disrupts accessible form labels","1.1.1 Keyboard Accessible Resources - Non-text content - The name, labels, icons, and other instructional content associated with user interface components should be accessible by keyboard users. (Specifically, duplicate IDs confuse screen readers, effectively preventing keyboard users from accurately navigating and interacting with form labels.)","This issue presents a significant accessibility barrier for users relying on assistive technologies, specifically screen readers. The duplication of HTML IDs within cached forms can cause screen readers to misinterpret form labels, leading to inaccurate guidance and difficulty completing form submissions. This directly violates WCAG guidelines regarding clear and predictable form navigation, hindering users with disabilities from fully engaging with the Drupal website. Remediation is critical to ensure a compliant and inclusive user experience.","This issue arises due to Drupal’s caching mechanism potentially reusing IDs across different form instances. While Drupal’s caching layers are designed to improve performance, they don’t guarantee unique IDs.  Currently, there isn’t a specific, documented Drupal patch addressing this directly. Mitigation strategies involve careful form design – ensuring unique IDs for form elements – and potentially configuring caching settings to prioritize consistency. A possible workaround (not a fix) is to manually prefix form IDs with a unique identifier.  Further investigation into the caching configuration and form rendering process is recommended to determine the root cause and extent of the problem.  Testing with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) is essential to verify the impact of the duplicated IDs."
CKEditor 5: scroll jump after dialog close,https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3410598,Needs work,Normal,ckeditor5.module,,CKEditor 5: scroll jump after dialog close,"1.1.1 – Level A: Behind the Curtain. This issue directly violates 1.1.1 – Behind the Curtain, which states that web content and user interface components shall be presented in a manner that is perceivable by users upon activation or interaction. The scroll jump disrupts the expected and predictable behavior, negatively impacting the user's ability to understand and navigate the content.  Specifically, the inconsistent scroll position creates a confusing experience for users utilizing assistive technologies that rely on predictable movement and position information.","This issue, ""CKEditor 5: scroll jump after dialog close,"" represents a significant accessibility barrier for users with disabilities, particularly those utilizing assistive technologies such as screen readers. The abrupt scroll jump following the closing of CKEditor 5 dialogs disrupts the expected navigation flow and can lead to disorientation and frustration. This violates established accessibility guidelines and negatively impacts the user experience for a segment of our user base. Further investigation and remediation are required to ensure consistent and predictable behavior.","This issue stems from an interaction between CKEditor 5's dialog management and the browser's scroll behavior. Specifically, the dialog's closure event doesn't always correctly reset the document's scroll position, resulting in a noticeable jump. There are currently no publicly available patches addressing this exact symptom.  A potential solution would involve implementing a more robust scroll reset function within the CKEditor 5 framework, perhaps utilizing a CSS reset function triggered upon dialog close. Alternatively, investigating browser-specific scroll behavior differences and applying targeted fixes could offer a solution. Thorough testing across multiple browsers is crucial."
[drupalMedia] Using the Insert Media button causes the window to scroll to the bottom of the page,https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3415961,Needs work,Normal,media system,,[drupalMedia] Using the Insert Media button causes the window to scroll to the bottom of the page,"1.1.1 Keyboard Accessible Area Operation -  This issue directly relates to WCAG 1.1.1, which states that all operable UI components and navigation elements must be keyboard accessible.  The automatic scrolling disrupts keyboard navigation and creates a barrier for users who cannot or prefer not to use a mouse.  The user cannot reliably trigger and interact with the ""Insert Media"" button using only a keyboard.","The Insert Media button within the Drupal Media module introduces a significant accessibility barrier for users, particularly those using screen readers or navigating with keyboard-only input. The automatic scrolling to the bottom of the page disrupts the user’s ability to focus on the button and interact with the media insertion process. This violates accessibility standards, potentially excluding users with motor impairments or those who rely on precise screen reader navigation. Remediation is required to ensure a seamless and accessible media insertion experience.",This issue likely stems from a JavaScript event handler or AJAX request triggered by the Insert Media button that's causing a page scroll to the bottom.  There are several potential causes:
HTML5 validation is preventing form submit and not fully accessible,https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/1797438,Needs work,Major,forms system,,HTML5 validation is preventing form submit and not fully accessible,"1.4.1 Use of Assistive Technologies – This is the most relevant WCAG success criterion. The issue directly relates to a user’s inability to interact with the form properly due to the validation preventing submission, and potentially inadequate ARIA attributes or keyboard navigation making it inaccessible.  Alternatively, 1.3.1 Perceptibility – If the form presents information in a way that is not perceivable to users with disabilities (e.g., insufficient color contrast), this would also be a relevant criterion.","The form is currently failing to submit due to strict HTML5 validation rules, significantly hindering user experience and potentially impacting data submission. Furthermore, the form’s design and implementation are not meeting accessibility standards, creating barriers for users with disabilities. Immediate remediation is required to ensure a functional and inclusive user experience, aligning with compliance regulations.","The core issue is likely related to overly restrictive HTML5 validation, potentially within the form’s HTML structure or server-side validation rules.  This is preventing the form from properly submitting. Patching likely involves reviewing and relaxing the validation rules, especially around required fields, data types, and error handling. Drupal’s built-in form modules often have extensive customization options for validation.  A thorough audit of the form’s HTML and associated server-side code is recommended. There may not be a single “patch,” but rather a series of adjustments.  Consider implementing more user-friendly error messaging and providing clear guidance for form completion.  Specifically, ensure labels are correctly associated with form fields and provide sufficient color contrast for interactive elements."
