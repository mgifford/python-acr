Inside categories we can sort by the order the keystroke was registered, as plugins groups are usually registered one after another, or...\r\n2. Add ordering inside a category through our favourite magic numbers (i.e. `order: 1003` etc.). This will be more difficult for 3rd party developers to manage but gives us more flexibility.

However, the visible text alternative field is quite small, about 35 characters. This requires the editor to keep what they have done in their head, increasing cognitive load, if they have anything that is longer. I believe a visible field length of perhaps 127 characters would be more reasonable, and it would be even better for the field to expand to fit the entire text alternative content.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1. In the CKEditor, select an image (for example, on the [CKEditor 5 demo](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/demo/html-support/), click the red 5 shield.\r\n2. Click the text alternative icon\r\n\r\nExpected result: the field is wide (or wide and tall) enough to be able to view a significant amount of text without having to scroll, or better yet, the entire contents of the all of the text alternative field.\r\n\r\nActual result: the field is wide enough to be able to view only about 35 characters, which can be insufficient for a sufficiently complex image. If the text alternative is longer than that, there is no way for the editor to view the entire alternative text at once.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/assets/3281090/1cc4213e-f7e7-43f0-a0ef-26b3f6d67a11)\r\n\r\nWhile 35 characters may be sufficient to describe the red 5 shield, it is inadequate for an image such as the following:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/assets/3281090/0e4e06a5-ec71-4299-944d-832cb4b6ddc6)\r\n\r\nfor which the text alternative is:\r\n\r\n> Two images. One shows the rear interior of a Muni bus with yellow poles and blue seats. Above the seats, a four digit bus number \"6553\" is circled in red. The second image shows the front of the bus.

CKEditor has also turned row headers in the second column to td elements with a scope attribute, which is invalid, and causes further accessibility issues.\r\n```\r\n<table>\r\n    <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 3\r\n        </th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"rowgroup\">\r\n            Rowgroup Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            &nbsp;\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            &nbsp;\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Subheader 1\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,1\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Subheader 2\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,2\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 3\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Subheader 3\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,3\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"rowgroup\">\r\n            Rowgroup Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            &nbsp;\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            &nbsp;\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 4\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Subheader 4\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,4\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Table 4\r\nCKEditor has added inline styles to col elements (strange), put all the rows after the thead block into one tbody block (again, potential data loss and makes the table inaccessible to screen readers). I'm not sure what the practical implications of this next quirk are, but I want to note it. CKEditor has added a non-breaking space character to an empty th tag. I don't think non-breaking spaces are [ASCII whitespace](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-whitespace). This means that the header cell is non-empty and user agents (including screen readers) should add it to the header list for the cells beneath it, according to the [spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/tables.html#header-and-data-cell-semantics).\r\n```\r\n<table class=\"ck-table-resized\">\r\n    <colgroup><col style=\"width:25%;\"><col style=\"width:25%;\"><col style=\"width:25%;\"><col style=\"width:25%;\"></colgroup><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>\r\n    <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>\r\n            &nbsp;\r\n        </th>\r\n        <th>\r\n            2008\r\n        </th>\r\n        <th>\r\n            2007\r\n        </th>\r\n        <th>\r\n            2006\r\n        </th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"rowgroup\">\r\n            Research and development\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            $ 1,109\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            $ 782\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            $ 712\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Percentage of net sales\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            3.4%\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            3.3%\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            3.7%\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"rowgroup\">\r\n            Selling, general, and administrative\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            $ 3,761\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            $ 2,963\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            $ 2,433\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Percentage of net sales\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            11.6%\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            12.3%\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            12.6%\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### \u2753 Possible solution\r\nAdd some kind of data attribute that tells CKEditor to not parse the table.

A lot of thought went into this package.\r\n\r\nAs the [We4Authors Cluster](https://accessibilitycluster.com/) highlighted, many accessibility issues are caused by giving the author more authority than they perhaps require. \r\n\r\n### \u2714\ufe0f Expected result\r\n\r\n- All [demos of CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/demo/) don't need to include accessibility, but there should be one that does.\r\n- The default install should be set up for accessibility best practices. Most website builders will just use the default, whatever it is -- so make it inclusive by default.\r\n- Setup the [Internationalization Demo ](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/demo/internationalization/)to support the [Language of Parts](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-parts.html) - good internationalization support isn't just one of many languages, but many combinations of many languages. CKEditor can do this, [so show it](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/language.html#demo).\r\n- Provide support for either [axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core), or [Editoria11y](https://editoria11y.princeton.edu/2021/03/introducing-editoria11y/) or [Sa11y](https://sa11y.netlify.app/) directly.\r\n\r\n### \u274c Actual result\r\n\r\n- Well, there aren't a lot of accessibility best practices baked into the demos. \r\n- There seems to be [support for Abbreviations](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/plugins/abbreviation-plugin/abbreviation-plugin-level-3.html), but not a lot of documentation about that\r\n- [Not sure what this is about ](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/spelling-and-grammar-checking.html#accessibility)\"The spell and grammar check is compliant with WCAG 2.1 and Section 508 accessibility standards.\" \r\n- \"CKEditor 5 provides support for alternate image text\" but [what is the default](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/images/images-text-alternative.html#additional-feature-information)? What about decorative, informative or complex images?\r\n- There's talk of using [CKEditor 5 plugins](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/plugins/plugins.html#common-use-cases) to \"Adding semantic value to the content, like annotations or accessibility features.\" but where are they?\r\n- Thanks for catching the [color contrast issues](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-35.html#changes-to-the-color-palette-in-the-ui) in the interface \"In this release, several changes were made to improve the accessibility and overall contrast of the UI.\"\r\n\r\n### \u2753 Possible solution\r\n\r\n- There is a great example to build on using CKEditor 4 plugins. Use it.\r\n- Focus on making the defaults accessible and it will benefit everyone\r\n- Check for accessibility early in the development process\r\n- Look for ways to be a best practice authoring tool that is following ATAG 2.0 & following the guidance in the We4Authors Cluster study.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to see this fixed sooner, add a \ud83d\udc4d reaction to this post.\r\n",

At the moment the toolbar item is labelled by the currently selected option only, meaning it doesn't provide context for the menu itself, e.g. screen readers read out \"Paragraph menu button collapsed sub menu\" but doesn't notify the user that the dropdown selector is for heading levels.

    "context": "## \ud83d\udcdd Provide a description of the improvement\r\n\r\nI recently stumbled upon one thing connected to editable focus in CKE5.\r\n\r\nSo, when the editor is in read only mode, it receives `contenteditable=false` which makes it not-focusable by the browser, as it doesn't have `tabindex` set. This messes up with some features that use editor's `FocusTracker` to operate (I mean focusing annotations for comments and track changes, in readonly mode).\r\n\r\nThis is not a critical issue for now, but I'd like us to think whether the editor should be or should not be focusable when it is in readonly mode. For me readonly and focusing are different properties. I mean, why should editor be not focusable if it is readonly? For example, for default browser fields, `readonly=true` fields are still focusable.\r\n\r\nThe easy fix around that is adding `tabindex=\"-1\"` to the editable element when it is in readonly mode. This will not mess up tabbing (tabbing will behave the same as it did in both readonly and normal mode). But it will enable clicking into markers to highlight annotations. However, this is the easy fix solution. Maybe there's more to that issue.\r\n\r\n@oleq prepared a fiddle you can play with: [https://jsfiddle.net/oleq/j6vdsx0q/5/](https://jsfiddle.net/oleq/j6vdsx0q/5/)",

Thanks to that algorithm, each block (usually the paragraph) can have its direction (when different than `dir=\"...\"` of the editable), which helps editing mixed content and saving it to the database. It obsoletes the [CKEditor 4 BiDi plugin](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/examples/language.html).\n\n* [ ]  It can be implemented using a set of RegExps, which are based on [official BiDi class definitions](http://www.unicode.org/Public/8.0.0/ucd/extracted/DerivedBidiClass.txt). For instance, facebook is using that in [their utils](https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/blob/master/packages/fbjs/src/unicode/UnicodeBidi.js).\n* [ ]  The UI of the editor can reflect the direction of the block, e.g. the icons can be mirrored dynamically.
