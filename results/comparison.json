    "context": "## Build good accessibility defaults\r\n\r\nA11yFirst has done a good job highlighting how CKEditor could be built more accessibly. Including elements like:\r\n- User guidance on headings\r\n- Support for Language of Parts\r\n- Show blocks (structural elements) & xpath like display\r\n- Accessible tables (headings/caption/summary)\r\n- Support for decorative, informative & complex images\r\n- Separating block structures vs formatting structures\r\n- A11yFirst Help\r\n- Maybe more...  A lot of thought went into this package.\r\n\r\nAs the [We4Authors Cluster](https://accessibilitycluster.com/) highlighted, many accessibility issues are caused by giving the author more authority than they perhaps require. \r\n\r\n### \u2714\ufe0f Expected result\r\n\r\n- All [demos of CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/demo/) don't need to include accessibility, but there should be one that does.\r\n- The default install should be set up for accessibility best practices.

It has also put all the rows after the thead block into one tbody block. This makes the table inaccessible to screen readers and is a loss of data, since we can no longer reconstruct the original table due to loss of the tbody blocks.\r\n```\r\n<table>\r\n    <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 3\r\n        </th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th colspan=\"3\" scope=\"rowgroup\">\r\n            Rowgroup Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th colspan=\"3\" scope=\"rowgroup\">\r\n            Rowgroup Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,1\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 2,1\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,2\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 2,2\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 3\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,3\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 2,3\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Table 3\r\nCKEditor has not moved all the parent rows for rowgroup headers into the thead element, but has put all the rows after the thead block into one tbody block. This causes data loss, since we can no longer reconstruct the original table due to loss of the tbody blocks, and makes the table inaccessible to screen readers. CKEditor has also turned row headers in the second column to td elements with a scope attribute, which is invalid, and causes further accessibility issues.\r\n```\r\n<table>\r\n    <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 3\r\n        </th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"rowgroup\">\r\n            Rowgroup Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            &nbsp;\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            &nbsp;\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Subheader 1\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,1\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Subheader 2\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,2\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 3\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Subheader 3\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,3\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"rowgroup\">\r\n            Rowgroup Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            &nbsp;\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            &nbsp;\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 4\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Subheader 4\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,4\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Table 4\r\nCKEditor has added inline styles to col elements (strange), put all the rows after the thead block into one tbody block (again, potential data loss and makes the table inaccessible to screen readers).

Paste the HTML from tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 (below) into source view of the [reference implementation of CKEditor](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/demo/html-support/). \r\n2.

We've also added some row headers to the second column and a tbody block that doesn't have any th with a scope set to rowgroup.\r\n```\r\n<table>\r\n    <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">Col Header 1</th>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">Col Header 2</th>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">Col Header 3</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"rowgroup\">Rowgroup Header 1</th>\r\n        <td></td>\r\n        <td></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">Row Header 1</th>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">Row Subheader 1</th>\r\n        <td>Data 1,1</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">Row Header 2</th>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">Row Subheader 2</th>\r\n        <td>Data 1,2</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">Row Header 3</th>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">Row Subheader 3</th>\r\n        <td>Data 1,3</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"rowgroup\">Rowgroup Header 2</th>\r\n        <td></td>\r\n        <td></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">Row Header 4</th>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">Row Subheader 4</th>\r\n        <td>Data 1,4</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Table 4\r\nThis table is an [example from the HTML spec](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/demo/html-support/).\r\n```\r\n<table>\r\n    <colgroup> <col>\r\n    <colgroup> <col> <col> <col>\r\n    <thead>\r\n    <tr> <th> <th>2008 <th>2007 <th>2006\r\n    <tbody>\r\n    <tr> <th scope=rowgroup> Research and development\r\n        <td> $ 1,109 <td> $ 782 <td> $ 712\r\n    <tr> <th scope=row> Percentage of net sales\r\n        <td> 3.4% <td> 3.3% <td> 3.7%\r\n    <tbody>\r\n    <tr> <th scope=rowgroup> Selling, general, and administrative\r\n        <td> $ 3,761 <td> $ 2,963 <td> $ 2,433\r\n    <tr> <th scope=row> Percentage of net sales\r\n        <td> 11.6% <td> 12.3% <td> 12.6%\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### \u2714\ufe0f Expected result\r\n\r\nCKEditor does not alter the table markup.\r\n\r\n### \u274c Actual result\r\n\r\n#### Table 1\r\nCKEditor has moved the parent row for \"Rowgroup Header 1\" into the thead element, which makes the table inaccessible to screen readers.\r\n```\r\n<table>\r\n    <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 3\r\n        </th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th colspan=\"3\" scope=\"rowgroup\">\r\n            Rowgroup Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,1\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 2,1\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Table 2\r\nCKEditor has moved all the parent rows for rowgroup headers into the thead element. It has also put all the rows after the thead block into one tbody block. This makes the table inaccessible to screen readers and is a loss of data, since we can no longer reconstruct the original table due to loss of the tbody blocks.\r\n```\r\n<table>\r\n    <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 3\r\n        </th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th colspan=\"3\" scope=\"rowgroup\">\r\n            Rowgroup Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th colspan=\"3\" scope=\"rowgroup\">\r\n            Rowgroup Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,1\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 2,1\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,2\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 2,2\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 3\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,3\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 2,3\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Table 3\r\nCKEditor has not moved all the parent rows for rowgroup headers into the thead element, but has put all the rows after the thead block into one tbody block. This causes data loss, since we can no longer reconstruct the original table due to loss of the tbody blocks, and makes the table inaccessible to screen readers. CKEditor has also turned row headers in the second column to td elements with a scope attribute, which is invalid, and causes further accessibility issues.\r\n```\r\n<table>\r\n    <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n        <th scope=\"col\">\r\n            Col Header 3\r\n        </th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"rowgroup\">\r\n            Rowgroup Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            &nbsp;\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            &nbsp;\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 1\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Subheader 1\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,1\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Subheader 2\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,2\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 3\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Subheader 3\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,3\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"rowgroup\">\r\n            Rowgroup Header 2\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td>\r\n            &nbsp;\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            &nbsp;\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Header 4\r\n        </th>\r\n        <td scope=\"row\">\r\n            Row Subheader 4\r\n        </td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            Data 1,4\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Table 4\r\nCKEditor has added inline styles to col elements (strange), put all the rows after the thead block into one tbody block (again, potential data loss and makes the table inaccessible to screen readers).

Virtual cursor is then set on the correct content navigated.\n\n### \u2753 Possible solution\n\nWhen we're linking to static content that doesn't already have the `tabindex` attribute, we should add it for the user.\n\nUse `tabindex=\"-1\"` and not `tabindex=\"0\"` nor `tabindex=\"1\"` (or any positive number) to avoid messing up sequential focus navigation orders.\n\n[Does the @tabable/accessible-links node package help?](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tabable/accessible-links)\n\nFurther reading: https://tab-able.co.uk/inaccessible-links-you-didnt-know-existed/\n\n## \ud83d\udcc3 Other details\n\n* Browser: Chrome\n* OS: Windows\n* First affected CKEditor version: 5\n* Installed CKEditor plugins: Bookmark, Link\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like to see this fixed sooner, add a \ud83d\udc4d reaction to this post.",

If these are unsuitable, investigate if the custom element can be refactored to utilize a more accessible alternative.  If a custom element *must* be used, then thorough ARIA implementation is crucial.  Use `role=\"group\"` to define the grouping, `role=\"button\"` or `role=\"checkbox\"` (if appropriate) for the selection element, and ensure `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` provides clear and concise context for screen reader users.  Avoid overly complex or custom ARIA attributes; prioritize clarity and straightforward descriptions. Ensure sufficient color contrast for any interactive elements.

When native HTML semantics aren't sufficient to convey the intended purpose and relationship of the block, then judicious use of WAI-ARIA roles can be employed. Specifically, the theme layer should be designed to *apply* these ARIA roles based on the block classification defined during module creation.  Consider utilizing a design system with pre-defined block types and associated ARIA attributes for consistency.  Refer to WAI-ARIA 1.2 for best practices on role usage.

For example, using `aria-describedby` to link to a more detailed explanation. Prioritize a clear heading structure (using `<h1>` for the page title, `<h2>` for sections of changes, and `<h3>` for specific modifications).

To address the lack of text alternatives, first, identify all non-text content \u2013 images, icons, videos, charts, and any element whose purpose isn\u2019t immediately apparent from its context. For images, provide descriptive `alt` text that accurately conveys the image\u2019s content and function.  For complex visuals (charts, diagrams), consider providing a textual description alongside the visual or link to a detailed explanation.  If using icons, ensure the icon's purpose is clearly conveyed within the surrounding text.  Utilize semantic HTML elements like `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` to structure image content appropriately.  Avoid using ARIA attributes to mimic native semantics; this can create confusion for assistive technologies.  If native semantics are insufficient, apply ARIA attributes to clarify the purpose and role of an element, referencing WAI-ARIA 1.2 for correct usage.

The `<figcaption>` element *must* be directly nested within the `<figure>` element and describe the image.  This is the primary and preferred solution. 2. **ARIA (if necessary):** If the image is dynamically loaded or the figure element doesn't inherently convey its role, consider using `role=\"img\"` on the image element and `aria-describedby` to link to the `<figcaption>` element. However, this should only be used if native semantic HTML cannot adequately fulfill the purpose. 3. **Content:** Ensure the figcaption accurately describes the image's content and purpose.  For complex images, a longer, more detailed figcaption is expected and beneficial. 4. **Testing:** Verify that screen readers announce the figure element and its associated figcaption correctly. Use a screen reader (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) to confirm accessibility.  Consider automated accessibility testing as part of the development workflow.",

Ensure the `alt` text for the image is descriptive and concise, and that it accurately describes the image content for screen reader users.  This structure provides native accessibility and avoids the need for ARIA attributes.

Consider using a native `<select>` element for the filter input, if appropriate for the type of filter.

If experimental profiles are presented as new options, use `<button>` elements with appropriate labels for each, ensuring each button\u2019s text clearly indicates its function (e.g., \"Install Experimental Profile - Alpha\").  If additional information is needed for each profile, consider using `<details>` and `<summary>` elements to group related information. These allow users to expand or collapse sections of text for better readability and to avoid overwhelming the screen.  Ensure sufficient color contrast for all text and interactive elements, adhering to WCAG 1.4.1.  If native HTML doesn't adequately provide the necessary semantics, then utilize ARIA attributes judiciously.  For instance, `role=\"button\"` on `<button>` elements and `aria-describedby` to link to informative text. Avoid using ARIA roles like `role=\"tablist\"` or `role=\"tab\"`, as these are not suitable for general profile selection.  Prioritize a logical reading order.

Avoid using ARIA solely to restructure headings; instead, correct the underlying heading hierarchy.  For example, if a nested list is presented as a series of divs, transform it into a `<ol>` or `<ul>` element with appropriate `aria-level` attributes if necessary.

The immediate priority is to investigate if the existing form error presentation is already accessible.  If errors are displayed inline within the form fields, ensuring appropriate ARIA attributes are applied to the error elements themselves is the first step. Specifically, the error elements should have `role=\"alert\"` and a descriptive `aria-live` attribute indicating changes to the error message.  A more robust solution would be to use a standard HTML element like `<fieldset>` or `<legend>` for grouping related form elements and ensuring labels are properly associated with their controls.  If the summary is presented in a separate area *after* form submission, a standard notification or alert mechanism (accessible ARIA live regions) should be used instead of a custom property.  Do not rely solely on a CSS-only solution for hiding the summary, as this will not provide screen reader users with alternative ways to access the information. Focus on semantic HTML first.",

If filtering is client\u2011side, attach a keyup/keyup listener to the input and update the module list DOM. 4. After filtering, update the results container (e.g., <div id=\"module-list\">) with aria-live=\"polite\" so screen reader users hear the change. 5. Test the filter with a keyboard-only workflow and a screen reader (NVDA/VoiceOver) to confirm focus, label, and live updates function correctly.",

Specifically, apply `role=\"tablist\"` to the parent container and `role=\"tab\"`, `aria-selected=\"false\"` to the \"Content Type\" tab itself. Ensure sufficient contrast between the tab\u2019s visual indicator and background. Prioritize ensuring the tab is logically associated with its content through keyboard navigation.

If a true drag-and-drop functionality is implemented with JavaScript, ensure keyboard equivalents are provided for all drag-and-drop actions, conforming to WCAG 2.2 Keyboard Interaction Guidelines (Guideline 2.4.7). Use ARIA attributes sparingly\u2014only when native HTML semantics are inadequate.  For example, `role=\"grid\"` is generally discouraged; focus on using appropriate `role=\"cell\"`, `role=\"row\"`, and `role=\"column\"` attributes *in conjunction* with semantic HTML.

To address this, developers should prioritize using semantic HTML to clearly identify and label each filter field.  Specifically, use `<label>` elements associated with each `<input>` or `<select>` element, ensuring the `for` attribute correctly links the label to the corresponding control.  The label text should precisely reflect the filter's function.  If native HTML elements are insufficient to convey the filter\u2019s purpose (e.g., complex filter logic requiring a description), then utilize ARIA attributes like `aria-label` or `aria-describedby` to provide additional context.  Avoid using ARIA to replace proper semantic labels. Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background within the label and filter field for users with low vision.  A good starting point is using a consistent naming convention across all filter fields (e.g., \u201cFilter by [Criteria]\u201d).",

The core accessibility concern is that JavaScript-driven pointer cancellation disrupts expected interaction patterns. Developers should prioritize a semantic HTML structure that supports the intended user flow. If JavaScript is *required* to achieve the desired interaction, then use ARIA attributes judiciously to provide alternative ways for users to trigger the same behaviour. Specifically, investigate if the pointer cancellation is truly necessary \u2013 often, a well-designed interaction can be achieved with standard keyboard navigation. Consider using `role=\"dialog\"` and `role=\"alert\"` with appropriate ARIA attributes to provide focus management for modal dialogs created by JavaScript.  Avoid directly interfering with the natural pointer cancellation behavior of the browser.  Utilize `focus()` calls strategically to ensure keyboard focus lands in the appropriate element after a cancellation.",

The primary focus should be on ensuring keyboard accessibility.  First, verify that the element triggered by the mousedown event is a focusable element (e.g., a button, link, or input field). If it isn\u2019t, add appropriate focus management.  Specifically, consider using `tabindex=\"0\"` on the element *only* if necessary to bring it into the tab order.  Avoid using `tabindex` unless absolutely required, as it can create accessibility issues if not implemented correctly.  If the event handler is correctly associated with a focusable element, ensure that the associated action provides the appropriate ARIA roles and states to clearly communicate the element\u2019s function to screen reader users. Review the relevant WAI-ARIA documentation (https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/) for appropriate roles and states.

Prioritize using semantic HTML for the language switcher. Consider a `<nav>` element for the switcher itself, and `<a href>` elements for each language option.  If a visual representation of the language is also present (e.g., a flag icon), ensure sufficient ARIA attributes are used to convey the language to screen reader users if native HTML does not fully provide the necessary information.

Specifically, determine if the high contrast theme is applied through CSS classes or inline styles.  If applied via CSS classes, the ideal solution is to ensure these classes properly override the Claro base styles and utilize appropriate CSS layering (e.g., using `z-index` judiciously *after* addressing color contrast) to maintain proper visual hierarchy.  If inline styles are used, refactor to use CSS classes for greater maintainability and control.  Crucially, verify that the chosen color combinations within the high contrast mode meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA success criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast Ratio) for text and background. Use tools like WebAIM's Color Contrast Checker to confirm the contrast ratio. Avoid relying solely on ARIA attributes for this issue; a well-structured CSS solution addressing color contrast is the primary solution.

Focus on providing sufficient visual contrast between form elements and their background, and between different states (e.g., focus, error, disabled).  Semantic HTML should be the primary solution.  Ensure each form element has a clear label associated with it using the `<label>` element. Utilize the `required` attribute where appropriate to indicate mandatory fields.  For managing states, leverage built-in browser focus indicators and CSS styling to clearly highlight the active state of form elements.  If visual contrast alone is insufficient to convey state, consider using ARIA attributes like `aria-describedby` to link the element to a more detailed explanation.

Investigate how media queries are set up for different screen sizes and text zoom levels (e.g., using `em` or `rem` units instead of fixed pixel values for media query breakpoints and element sizing). CSS `max-width` constraints on elements within the container may be too large and not scaling appropriately. Check for any CSS that relies on JavaScript to calculate widths based on screen size, and ensure these calculations properly accommodate text scaling. Consider using CSS Grid or Flexbox for a more responsive layout. Search Drupal.org for existing issues related to reflow and text scaling; a patch might exist that addresses a similar problem.

This is typically achieved through the use of `<button>` elements for menu items and the `tabindex` attribute judiciously, if at all. If the menu is a dropdown or modal, verify that keyboard focus is properly trapped within the element and that the elements are focusable.  If native HTML elements (e.g., `<button>`, `<select>`) cannot achieve the desired keyboard navigation behavior, utilize ARIA attributes to define the role, state, and keyboard focus order. Specifically, use `role=\"menu\"`, `role=\"menuitem\"`, `aria-haspopup=\"true\"`, `aria-expanded=\"false\"` (initially) and `aria-keysfocus` to indicate which element receives focus when a menu item is navigated to. Avoid using ARIA to simply duplicate existing HTML semantics. Refer to WAI-ARIA 1.2 documentation for best practices.

Be sure to apply appropriate CSS styling to match the visual design. Check Drupal.org for existing contributed modules or patches that may provide similar functionality. Search for modules related to 'field label heading' or 'semantic headings'.",

If native HTML semantics are insufficient to meet WCAG requirements, utilize ARIA attributes judiciously, following WAI-ARIA 1.2 guidelines. Common issues resolved with ARIA include `role=\"button\"` for non-semantic buttons, `aria-label` for missing visible labels, and `aria-expanded` for collapsible elements. Prioritize semantic HTML; ARIA should only be used to *augment* existing semantics, not replace them.  Document all ARIA implementations thoroughly.

To address this, developers should focus on configuring PHPUnit to execute established accessibility testing tools and frameworks.  Specifically, integrate a tool like Axe DevTools or WAVE into the PHPUnit test suite. Configure the tool to report violations of WCAG 2.2 Level AA.  The first step is to establish a solid foundation of semantic HTML. Ensure all elements have appropriate roles and labels where possible. Utilize ARIA attributes *only* as a last resort, carefully following WAI-ARIA guidelines.  Examples of ARIA attributes to consider (and only after assessing if native HTML can achieve the same functionality) include `role=\"button\"` for custom buttons, `aria-label` for missing text, and `aria-expanded` for collapsible elements. Documentation for Axe DevTools and WAVE are excellent resources: [https://www.axe-core.com/](https://www.axe-core.com/) and [https://wave.io/](https://wave.io/).  Focus on test cases that cover common accessibility issues like missing alt text, insufficient color contrast, improper heading structure, and keyboard navigation problems.

If a native label isn't feasible, then implement an `aria-label` attribute. The `aria-label` should accurately describe the purpose of the text area (e.g., \"Insert text here\"). Ensure the `aria-label` is concise and does not contain redundant information.  Avoid overly descriptive labels; focus on the user\u2019s intent.  Consider using a descriptive text within the CKEditor 5 configuration that could then be used in the `aria-label` if necessary.  Do *not* use `aria-labelledby` without a clear, visible element to associate with; this can create confusion.

The first step is to ensure the mobile navigation is logically structured with clear headings and sufficient keyboard focus order.  Specifically, ensure that the navigation items are focusable via the `Tab` key.  If focus *does* escape the navigation on mobile, consider using `tabindex=\"0\"` on the navigation element and then carefully control the tab order using the `tabindex` attribute.  Apply `tabindex=\"0\"` only to the navigation container and ensure it is the *first* element in the tab order. Test thoroughly with keyboard-only navigation to confirm the expected behavior.

If a native announcement is not possible, use `aria-describedby` to link the recommendation element to a hidden element containing the text. Implement ARIA attributes to announce the recommendation state, such as `aria-live=\"polite\"` on an element that updates with recommendations.  Avoid using `role=\"alert\"` as it\u2019s primarily for errors. Ensure the recommended password is announced clearly and concisely. Prioritize semantic HTML and minimize the use of ARIA.

For example, if a visually hidden element is required to provide context to a smaller component, utilize `aria-describedby` to link the elements. Ensure appropriate color contrast ratios are maintained, as this can impact visibility.  Consider using relative units (em, rem, %, vw, vh) for sizing to allow for responsive design.

Ensure proper use of the `scope` attribute on `<th>` elements to correctly associate headers with their corresponding data cells. Avoid using `<div>` or `<span>` elements to wrap table content; this removes semantic meaning.  If native table semantics cannot adequately represent the table\u2019s structure or if complex table features are needed (e.g., frozen columns), then carefully apply ARIA attributes.  For example, `aria-label` can provide a descriptive label for the table if no visible text exists, and `aria-colspan` and `aria-rowspan` can be used to manage cell spanning.

To ensure accessibility, developers should: 1. Verify that the HTML5 input types are being correctly interpreted by the assistive technology stack (screen readers). 2. Ensure the semantic HTML structure is correctly applied to the form. For example, use `<label>` elements associated with each input field, ensuring the `for` attribute correctly matches the input's `id`. 3.  If the screen reader isn't announcing the correct input type hint (e.g., \"email\" for `<input type=\"email\">`), investigate the assistive technology configuration or potential issues with the screen reader.
