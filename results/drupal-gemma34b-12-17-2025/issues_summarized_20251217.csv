3426798,CKEditor 5 text area doesn't have appropriate aria-label for screen reader,CKEditor 5 text area doesn't have appropriate aria-label for screen reader,https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3426798,drupal,Needs work,Normal,ckeditor5.module,11.x-dev,1 year 9 months,General,General,"Users relying on screen readers may experience difficulty identifying and interacting with the CKEditor 5 text area due to the absence of a clear, descriptive `aria-label` attribute. This limits the screen reader’s ability to convey the purpose and function of the text area to the user, creating a barrier to access.","The issue reports a missing `aria-label` for the CKEditor 5 text area. This is a common accessibility concern. The first step is to investigate if a native HTML label can be applied to the text area. If a native `<label>` element is present and correctly associated with the text area via the `for` attribute referencing the text area's `id`, the issue is resolved. If a native label isn't feasible, then implement an `aria-label` attribute. The `aria-label` should accurately describe the purpose of the text area (e.g., ""Insert text here""). Ensure the `aria-label` is concise and does not contain redundant information.  Avoid overly descriptive labels; focus on the user’s intent.  Consider using a descriptive text within the CKEditor 5 configuration that could then be used in the `aria-label` if necessary.  Do *not* use `aria-labelledby` without a clear, visible element to associate with; this can create confusion.  Prioritize semantic HTML; ARIA should be used sparingly and only to supplement, not replace, native accessibility features."

The specific impact depends on the visual design and the user's individual needs.","The reported issue describes a visual artifact – the consistent display of lines within table structures. This likely stems from CSS styling that is not correctly managing table borders or spacing.  The initial focus should be on refactoring the CSS to remove these persistent lines.  Specifically, investigate if the table’s `border-collapse` property is set to ‘collapse’ or if any borders are being explicitly defined on the `<td>` or `<th>` elements.  Ensure that `border-spacing` is appropriately configured.  Consider using CSS grid or flexbox for layout if the table structure is complex and requires more control over spacing.  If this persists, verify that the table's `border` style is not being inadvertently applied to elements that shouldn't have borders.  Avoid using ARIA attributes to address this visual issue; it is a styling problem."

While this may trigger certain validation tools, it doesn't inherently create an accessibility barrier for users. The core accessibility issue is the potential misuse of the `required` attribute to convey form validation messages, which can be confusing and misleading for users relying on assistive technologies.","The W3C Validation failure regarding the `required` attribute on a `<fieldset>` tag is a matter of strict HTML5 validation and doesn't represent a core accessibility issue in itself.  The `required` attribute is not a valid attribute for `<fieldset>`. However, the underlying concern is likely the presentation of form validation messages.  Instead of relying on the `required` attribute, use semantic HTML and ARIA to communicate validation status effectively."

The primary solution involves using semantic HTML to represent the hierarchy.  Specifically, utilize nested `<select>` elements appropriately.  When nesting select elements, ensure sufficient contrast between the selected option and its parent element.  Avoid using indentation within the HTML itself for structural indication – this is not a reliable method for screen readers.  If nested select elements *must* be visually grouped, leverage CSS for styling, focusing on clear layering and appropriate spacing to provide visual cues to screen reader users.  ARIA attributes should *only* be used as a last resort to supplement, not replace, semantic HTML.

To resolve this, the developer should first investigate the HTML structure of the menu.  Specifically, ensure that each menu item is contained within a `<button>` element or a `<div>` with appropriate `tabindex` attributes if necessary to allow focus.  If the menu is a dropdown triggered by a `<div>`, then ensure that the dropdown is also a `<button>` element.  Avoid using `<div>` elements for navigation; leverage semantic HTML where possible.  If using ARIA, the `role=""menu""`, `role=""menuitem""`, and `aria-haspopup=""true""` attributes should be used on the parent menu container and menu items respectively.  Ensure the `tabindex` attribute is appropriately managed to maintain correct keyboard focus order. Consider using a standard, accessible menu pattern (e.g., a “flyout” menu triggered by a click on a button).  Prioritize native keyboard navigation over ARIA attributes."

The absence of a `#title` indicator suggests a potential lack of sufficient guidance for users to understand which fields are mandatory.,"This issue highlights a potential gap in form feedback mechanisms. To address this, prioritize utilizing semantic HTML to clearly delineate required fields. Specifically, employ the `<label>` element correctly associated with each form input, ensuring it’s programmatically associated with the input via the `for` attribute. This is the most effective and standards-compliant approach.  If semantic HTML alone cannot adequately convey the required status (e.g., due to complex form layouts or JavaScript manipulation affecting ARIA states), then consider using ARIA attributes like `aria-required=""true""` *on the `<label>` element*.  Crucially, ensure the error message itself is presented in a manner accessible to screen reader users—ideally within a `<div aria-live=""polite"">` element or another appropriate ARIA announcement mechanism, clearly stating the error and the field it relates to.  Do *not* rely solely on JavaScript-generated alerts or modal dialogs for validation feedback, as these often lack sufficient ARIA support.  For CSS, ensure proper layering for visual error indication, avoiding overlapping content."

This can prevent screen reader users from accurately identifying and interacting with the filter options, leading to difficulty in narrowing down search results and a degraded user experience.","This issue likely stems from a missing or incorrect `aria-label` attribute on the input element, or an improper relationship established between the label and the input using HTML. The first step is to ensure the label is directly associated with the input using either a `<label>` element with the `for` attribute referencing the input's ID, or, if a `<label>` isn’t feasible, use the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the input pointing to the visible label text.  If the label is visually hidden (using `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`), `aria-labelledby` is the appropriate solution.  Avoid using `aria-label` directly on the input element unless it's absolutely necessary to provide context where no other semantic element exists.  Verify the input’s ID is unique and correctly reflects its purpose within the search filter. Confirm that focus is appropriately trapped within the filter component when the user interacts with it."

This inconsistency creates a barrier to effective navigation and selection of filter criteria, potentially impacting administrative tasks.","The issue describes inconsistent labelling of filter fields within an admin list. To address this, developers should prioritize using semantic HTML to clearly identify and label each filter field.  Specifically, use `<label>` elements associated with each `<input>` or `<select>` element, ensuring the `for` attribute correctly links the label to the corresponding control.  The label text should precisely reflect the filter's function.  If native HTML elements are insufficient to convey the filter’s purpose (e.g., complex filter logic requiring a description), then utilize ARIA attributes like `aria-label` or `aria-describedby` to provide additional context.  Avoid using ARIA to replace proper semantic labels. Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background within the label and filter field for users with low vision.  A good starting point is using a consistent naming convention across all filter fields (e.g., “Filter by [Criteria]”)."

This impacts navigation and content discovery, potentially hindering accessibility for users with cognitive disabilities or those unfamiliar with the system.","The issue describes a need for natural language descriptions for links. The first step is to leverage semantic HTML. Replace the existing link text (""Article"" and ""Basic page"") with more descriptive phrases that clearly indicate the destination. For example, change ""Article"" to ""Create a new article"" and ""Basic page"" to ""Create a basic webpage"".  If a more concise label is required, ensure sufficient context exists on the destination page itself. Only if the descriptive text is too long to fit naturally within the link is ARIA appropriate. Consider using `aria-label` to provide a concise description, adhering to WAI-ARIA 1.2 guidelines.  Ensure the `aria-label` text is descriptive and does not contain redundant information. Prioritize the semantic HTML approach – this is the most robust and maintainable solution."
