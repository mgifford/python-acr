3426798,CKEditor 5 text area doesn't have appropriate aria-label for screen reader,CKEditor 5 text area doesn't have appropriate aria-label for screen reader,https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3426798,drupal,Needs work,Normal,ckeditor5.module,11.x-dev,1 year 9 months,General,General,"Users relying on screen readers may experience difficulty identifying and interacting with the CKEditor 5 text area due to the absence of a clear, descriptive `aria-label` attribute. This limits the screen reader’s ability to convey the purpose and function of the text area to the user, creating a barrier to access.","The issue reports a missing `aria-label` for the CKEditor 5 text area. This is a common accessibility concern. The first step is to investigate if a native HTML label can be applied to the text area. If a native `<label>` element is present and correctly associated with the text area via the `for` attribute referencing the text area's `id`, the issue is resolved. If a native label isn't feasible, then implement an `aria-label` attribute. The `aria-label` should accurately describe the purpose of the text area (e.g., ""Insert text here""). Ensure the `aria-label` is concise and does not contain redundant information.  Avoid overly descriptive labels; focus on the user’s intent.  Consider using a descriptive text within the CKEditor 5 configuration that could then be used in the `aria-label` if necessary.  Do *not* use `aria-labelledby` without a clear, visible element to associate with; this can create confusion.  Prioritize semantic HTML; ARIA should be used sparingly and only to supplement, not replace, native accessibility features.","CKEditor 5’s text area lacks a clear, accessible help message (aria-label) when required, impacting screen reader users. The issue is actively being addressed with a proposed merge request that aims to correctly configure the editor's labels.","Initial report identified that CKEditor 5's text area doesn't provide a readily accessible help message (via aria-label) when the field is marked as required. Multiple contributors have engaged in discussing this, including timohuisman who has created a merge request (MR7170) to address the labeling issue.

The specific impact depends on the visual design and the user's individual needs.","The reported issue describes a visual artifact – the consistent display of lines within table structures. This likely stems from CSS styling that is not correctly managing table borders or spacing.  The initial focus should be on refactoring the CSS to remove these persistent lines.  Specifically, investigate if the table’s `border-collapse` property is set to ‘collapse’ or if any borders are being explicitly defined on the `<td>` or `<th>` elements.  Ensure that `border-spacing` is appropriately configured.  Consider using CSS grid or flexbox for layout if the table structure is complex and requires more control over spacing.  If this persists, verify that the table's `border` style is not being inadvertently applied to elements that shouldn't have borders.  Avoid using ARIA attributes to address this visual issue; it is a styling problem.","The Table Drag feature consistently displays lines, impacting the visual clarity of the interface.

Specifically, integrate a tool like Axe DevTools or WAVE into the PHPUnit test suite. Configure the tool to report violations of WCAG 2.2 Level AA.  The first step is to establish a solid foundation of semantic HTML. Ensure all elements have appropriate roles and labels where possible. Utilize ARIA attributes *only* as a last resort, carefully following WAI-ARIA guidelines.  Examples of ARIA attributes to consider (and only after assessing if native HTML can achieve the same functionality) include `role=""button""` for custom buttons, `aria-label` for missing text, and `aria-expanded` for collapsible elements.

This typically indicates that the dropdown’s `select` element and its options (`option` elements) are not properly described for screen reader users.  The first step is to ensure correct semantic HTML. Specifically, each dropdown option should use the `<option>` tag with a `value` attribute that accurately represents the data being submitted when the option is selected.  The `<option>` tag’s text content should clearly describe the selection.  If the dropdown uses a JavaScript-driven suggestion list, the suggestion elements should also be properly labeled using ARIA attributes, prioritizing the `aria-label` attribute.  Avoid using `aria-labelledby` unless absolutely necessary to link to an existing, accessible label.  Ensure that the focus indicator for the dropdown is clearly visible.  If the dropdown suggestions are dynamically generated, utilize `aria-describedby` to associate the textual description with the relevant suggestion element.

This can result in a reduced understanding of tabular data, impacting usability for individuals who rely on assistive technology.","The issue title, “Improve accessibility for tables in views,” is too broad. A more specific approach is needed. The primary focus should be on using semantic HTML to structure tables.  Specifically, use the `<table`> element with appropriate `<th>` (table header) and `<td>` (table data) elements. Ensure proper use of the `scope` attribute on `<th>` elements to correctly associate headers with their corresponding data cells. Avoid using `<div>` or `<span>` elements to wrap table content; this removes semantic meaning.  If native table semantics cannot adequately represent the table’s structure or if complex table features are needed (e.g., frozen columns), then carefully apply ARIA attributes.  For example, `aria-label` can provide a descriptive label for the table if no visible text exists, and `aria-colspan` and `aria-rowspan` can be used to manage cell spanning.

This profile likely dictates how accessibility tests are run. Assuming this profile represents a set of accessibility testing rules and checks, the developers should implement a robust, automated accessibility testing workflow integrated into Nightwatch.  Specifically, ensure Nightwatch is configured to utilize established accessibility testing libraries and frameworks that align with WCAG 2.2 Level AA requirements.

The forced color palette may negatively impact the ability to distinguish content, especially for users with low vision or color blindness.","To address this issue, prioritize a semantic HTML structure. Verify that all content is properly structured with headings (<h1>-<h6>), lists (<ul>, <ol>, <dl>), and tables (<table, <tr>, <td>) to ensure proper screen reader interpretation. Next, thoroughly test Claro’s High Contrast mode to identify specific instances where color combinations cause readability issues. If native HTML elements are insufficient to provide sufficient contrast, implement ARIA attributes to appropriately convey the semantic meaning and purpose of the content. Specifically, use `aria-label` for images and custom controls and ensure proper role assignments. Evaluate the CSS architecture to confirm that color styling is correctly layered and doesn’t inadvertently conflict with the high contrast settings. Consider using relative units (em, rem, %) for sizing and spacing to maintain flexibility across different screen sizes and contrast levels.

The absence of descriptive labels and keyboard navigation cues prevents effective interaction and understanding of the table’s sortable data.,"To address this issue, prioritize implementing semantic HTML to structure the sortable columns. Specifically, use `<button>` elements with `aria-sort` and `aria-label` attributes to define the sort direction and provide a descriptive label for each column.  The `aria-sort` attribute should be set to ‘asc’ or ‘desc’ to indicate ascending or descending order. The `aria-label` attribute must clearly articulate the column’s content (e.g., ""Sales Revenue""). Ensure keyboard navigation is fully functional – users should be able to navigate to each column header using the Tab key and trigger the sorting action using the Enter key. Utilize CSS to visually indicate the current sort direction, but avoid relying solely on color for accessibility – provide alternative visual cues (e.g., an arrow icon) alongside text.

Specifically, use `<button>` elements with appropriate `role=""menu""` and potentially a child `<menu>` element to structure the menu items.  If native support for a menu is not possible, utilize ARIA attributes like `aria-haspopup=""true""` and `aria-expanded=""false""` (or `true` when expanded) on the main button to indicate the presence and state of the menu.  Each menu item within the Splitbutton should be a `<button>` element with the `role=""menuitem""` and `aria-level=""1""` (to represent the hierarchy within the menu).  Ensure sufficient color contrast for all interactive elements and labels.  Prioritize keyboard accessibility - focus management and proper focus states are critical.  Avoid relying solely on JavaScript to manage the menu's state; use ARIA to convey this state. Refer to the WAI-ARIA guidelines for best practices on implementing menus and dropdowns.

This can lead to a disjointed and confusing user experience, hindering effective access to tabular data.","The issue describes a usability concern related to sticky table headers. The primary solution is to ensure the table headers are not fixed to the top of the viewport. This is achieved through standard HTML table structure and CSS.  Specifically, avoid using `position: sticky` on the `thead` element.  Instead, allow the table headers to scroll with the content. If the table content exceeds the viewport height, a standard scrollbar will automatically appear, providing access to all rows.  If `thead` scrolling is not desired, the content within the `thead` should be contained within the `table` element using `overflow-y: auto;` on the `table` element and appropriately sized rows within the `tr` elements.  ARIA is *not* required in this scenario; the native HTML behavior provides the necessary accessibility.","A usability issue has been identified where table headers are not accessible for assistive technology users due to the sticky nature of the column. Initial attempts to address this have been made, but the solution is currently stalled due to conflicting feedback regarding the placement of the toggle.","The issue stems from the persistent display of a table column, making it inaccessible for users of assistive technologies like screen readers.

This could lead to errors in data entry and a degraded user experience.,"The request to ""create smaller variations for form elements"" is currently too vague to address accessibility concerns effectively. Accessibility isn’t about simply changing sizes; it’s about ensuring sufficient contrast and alternative ways to identify the element’s state. Focus on providing sufficient visual contrast between form elements and their background, and between different states (e.g., focus, error, disabled).  Semantic HTML should be the primary solution.  Ensure each form element has a clear label associated with it using the `<label>` element. Utilize the `required` attribute where appropriate to indicate mandatory fields.  For managing states, leverage built-in browser focus indicators and CSS styling to clearly highlight the active state of form elements.  If visual contrast alone is insufficient to convey state, consider using ARIA attributes like `aria-describedby` to link the element to a more detailed explanation.  Avoid using color alone to indicate state; always include a redundant visual cue.","The ""extrasmall"" button component in Claro’s Paragraphs UI has inconsistent vertical padding, creating a usability/accessibility issue where the buttons are unacceptably small, particularly for users with low vision.

This violates WCAG guidelines regarding the clarity of link text.","The issue report indicates a lack of conformance with WCAG language-of-parts. This means the link text within the language switcher block does not clearly identify the language being navigated to. To address this, ensure each link text accurately reflects the language it directs the user to (e.g., ""English"", ""Español"", ""Français"").  Prioritize using semantic HTML for the language switcher. Consider a `<nav>` element for the switcher itself, and `<a href>` elements for each language option.  If a visual representation of the language is also present (e.g., a flag icon), ensure sufficient ARIA attributes are used to convey the language to screen reader users if native HTML does not fully provide the necessary information. Specifically, utilize `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` appropriately, linking it to a visually descriptive element. Avoid using ARIA roles (like `role=""navigation""`) unnecessarily as this can mask underlying semantic HTML.

The absence of a `#title` indicator suggests a potential lack of sufficient guidance for users to understand which fields are mandatory.,"This issue highlights a potential gap in form feedback mechanisms. To address this, prioritize utilizing semantic HTML to clearly delineate required fields. Specifically, employ the `<label>` element correctly associated with each form input, ensuring it’s programmatically associated with the input via the `for` attribute. This is the most effective and standards-compliant approach.  If semantic HTML alone cannot adequately convey the required status (e.g., due to complex form layouts or JavaScript manipulation affecting ARIA states), then consider using ARIA attributes like `aria-required=""true""` *on the `<label>` element*.  Crucially, ensure the error message itself is presented in a manner accessible to screen reader users—ideally within a `<div aria-live=""polite"">` element or another appropriate ARIA announcement mechanism, clearly stating the error and the field it relates to.

The root cause needs investigation. First, review the theme’s logic for handling these arrays. Ensure that the theme is correctly interpreting and applying visibility rules based on the data. The theme should utilize semantic HTML to control visibility and should not rely solely on JavaScript to manage this. If JavaScript is necessary, implement ARIA attributes judiciously, focusing on roles like `role=""region""` and `role=""tab""` to provide semantic context where native HTML elements lack sufficient information. Specifically, ensure that the theme correctly uses `aria-hidden=""true""` on elements that should be hidden from screen readers. Focus on ensuring the underlying data structure is accessible – providing accessible labels and descriptions for any data being retrieved. Validate the theme’s JavaScript code with accessibility testing tools.  Consider if a simpler, more direct approach using semantic HTML to control visibility would be more maintainable and accessible.","The issue involves inconsistent renderable array checks in Drupal themes, potentially leading to layout shifts and a jarring user experience. Recent activity focuses on understanding the root cause and exploring potential fixes, but no definitive resolution has been reached.

Multiple participants (markhalliwell, fabianx, rainbowarray) have discussed the issue relating to renderable array behavior and its potential impact on layout.

The absence of explicit screen reader announcements during filtering prevents users with screen reader assistance from understanding the filter's applied criteria and the resulting list changes. This impacts usability and potentially prevents users from effectively utilizing the Views List functionality.,"To address this issue, prioritize implementing semantic HTML to clearly indicate the filter’s operation. Specifically, wrap the filter input fields and the filtered views display in a `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` element. The `<legend>` should clearly state the filter criteria (e.g., ""Filter by Name"").  When filtering, the screen reader should announce the filter criteria being applied.  Consider using a native `<select>` element for the filter input, if appropriate for the type of filter. If a `<select>` is not feasible, ensure the input field is properly labeled with a `<label>` element associated with the input via the `for` attribute. ARIA should only be employed as a last resort to supplement native semantics.  If a native solution is insufficient, use `aria-describedby` to link the filter input field to a description of the filtering operation.

This prevents them from understanding the outcome of the action and completing tasks effectively.,"This issue likely stems from a lack of accessible presentation of the bulk action results. The primary solution should involve using semantic HTML to structure the results. Specifically, consider using a `<ol>` or `<ul>` element to list the individual results.  Each list item should contain descriptive text conveying the outcome of the action.  If a more complex display is required (e.g., displaying status messages alongside results), investigate using a table with appropriate headers. Ensure the table is programmatically separated and that cells are labelled appropriately.  Avoid using ARIA attributes solely to announce the results; prioritize native HTML semantics. If native semantics cannot adequately convey the information, utilize ARIA attributes like `role=""region""` and `aria-live=""polite""` to announce updates to the results list, but only as a last resort.

The core problem is the *implementation* of HTML5 form input types, not the META tag itself.  It’s assumed the system is attempting to correctly leverage the semantic meaning of the HTML5 input types (e.g., `type=""email""` automatically provides a hint for email input). To ensure accessibility, developers should: 1. Verify that the HTML5 input types are being correctly interpreted by the assistive technology stack (screen readers). 2. Ensure the semantic HTML structure is correctly applied to the form. For example, use `<label>` elements associated with each input field, ensuring the `for` attribute correctly matches the input's `id`. 3.

This impacts navigation and content discovery, potentially hindering accessibility for users with cognitive disabilities or those unfamiliar with the system.","The issue describes a need for natural language descriptions for links. The first step is to leverage semantic HTML. Replace the existing link text (""Article"" and ""Basic page"") with more descriptive phrases that clearly indicate the destination. For example, change ""Article"" to ""Create a new article"" and ""Basic page"" to ""Create a basic webpage"".  If a more concise label is required, ensure sufficient context exists on the destination page itself. Only if the descriptive text is too long to fit naturally within the link is ARIA appropriate. Consider using `aria-label` to provide a concise description, adhering to WAI-ARIA 1.2 guidelines.  Ensure the `aria-label` text is descriptive and does not contain redundant information. Prioritize the semantic HTML approach – this is the most robust and maintainable solution.","The Create Content page lacks natural language descriptions for Article and Basic page links, potentially impacting screen reader users.
