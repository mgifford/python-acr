            **LEVEL:** does-not-support


            **REMARKS:**  Multiple open issues indicate significant accessibility
            barriers for screen reader users across form elements, tables, and messaging.
            Specifically, challenges exist with required field identification, tabular
            data interpretation, required field communication, status indication,
            and feedback for completed operations.  These issues collectively impair
            usability and potentially impact data accuracy.

            barrier for users sensitive to motion. Specifically, the website’s behavior
            may conflict with user-configured “reduce motion” settings and the system
            lacks a mechanism to reduce or disable animation effects.
