{"query": "The \u201creduce motion\u201d setting in the operating system should be respected", "context": "The \u201creduce motion\u201d setting in the operating system should be respected", "response": "This Drupal site exhibits a significant accessibility barrier by failing to respect user-configured \"reduce motion\" settings within their operating systems. This impacts users with vestibular disorders, migraines, or other sensitivities to animation and movement, causing potential discomfort, nausea, or distraction.  The absence of respect for these settings violates best practices for inclusive design and can contribute to a negative user experience. Remediation is required to ensure consistent accessibility across different operating systems and user preferences."}
{"query": "Cached forms can have duplicate HTML IDs, which disrupts accessible form labels", "context": "Cached forms can have duplicate HTML IDs, which disrupts accessible form labels", "response": "This issue presents a significant accessibility barrier for users relying on assistive technologies, specifically screen readers. The duplication of HTML IDs within cached forms can cause screen readers to misinterpret form labels, leading to inaccurate guidance and difficulty completing form submissions. This directly violates WCAG guidelines regarding clear and predictable form navigation, hindering users with disabilities from fully engaging with the Drupal website. Remediation is critical to ensure a compliant and inclusive user experience."}
{"query": "CKEditor 5: scroll jump after dialog close", "context": "CKEditor 5: scroll jump after dialog close", "response": "This issue, \"CKEditor 5: scroll jump after dialog close,\" represents a significant accessibility barrier for users with disabilities, particularly those utilizing assistive technologies such as screen readers. The abrupt scroll jump following the closing of CKEditor 5 dialogs disrupts the expected navigation flow and can lead to disorientation and frustration. This violates established accessibility guidelines and negatively impacts the user experience for a segment of our user base. Further investigation and remediation are required to ensure consistent and predictable behavior."}
{"query": "[drupalMedia] Using the Insert Media button causes the window to scroll to the bottom of the page", "context": "[drupalMedia] Using the Insert Media button causes the window to scroll to the bottom of the page", "response": "The Insert Media button within the Drupal Media module introduces a significant accessibility barrier for users, particularly those using screen readers or navigating with keyboard-only input. The automatic scrolling to the bottom of the page disrupts the user\u2019s ability to focus on the button and interact with the media insertion process. This violates accessibility standards, potentially excluding users with motor impairments or those who rely on precise screen reader navigation. Remediation is required to ensure a seamless and accessible media insertion experience."}
{"query": "HTML5 validation is preventing form submit and not fully accessible", "context": "HTML5 validation is preventing form submit and not fully accessible", "response": "The form is currently failing to submit due to strict HTML5 validation rules, significantly hindering user experience and potentially impacting data submission. Furthermore, the form\u2019s design and implementation are not meeting accessibility standards, creating barriers for users with disabilities. Immediate remediation is required to ensure a functional and inclusive user experience, aligning with compliance regulations."}
